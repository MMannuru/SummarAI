Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction and machine learning method used to simplify alarge data set into a smaller set while still maintaining significant patterns and trends. Principal components are new variables that are constructed as linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. As there are as many principal components as there are variables in the data, principal components are constructed in such a manner that the first component accounts for the largest possible variance.
